===> variable <===
- Names are case-sensitive, lowercase and uppercase are different.
- Start variable names with a letter, use camelCase for names.
- Variable names should be self-descriptive, describing the stored value.
- Boolean variables are usually prefixed with `is` or `has`.

===> constants <===
- JavaScript constants are also case-sensitive. However, these constants should
  be written in uppercase because they are non changing variables.
- Define constants at the top of your file, function or class.
- Sometimes `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` is used, while other times plain camelCase.
