- JavaScript function names are also case-sensitive. So, similar to variables, 
  the camel case approach is the recommended way to declare function names.
- So start function names with a letter, use camelCase for names.
- Use descriptive names, usually verbs in the imperative form.
- Common prefixes are `get`, `make`, `apply` etc.
